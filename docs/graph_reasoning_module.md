# Graph Reasoning Module

This document describes the Graph Reasoning module, which is part of the Knowledge Graph Synthesis System. The module provides functionality for advanced reasoning over knowledge graphs, including path-based reasoning, conflict detection, and resolution.

## Overview

The Graph Reasoning module enables the system to perform advanced reasoning over the knowledge graph, including:

1. **Path-based Reasoning**: Analyzing paths between entities to derive new insights and infer relationships
2. **Conflict Detection**: Identifying logical contradictions in the graph
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Automatically resolving detected conflicts based on confidence scores
4. **Inference**: Deriving new relationships based on existing knowledge

## Components

### `GraphReasoning` Class

The main class that provides methods for reasoning over knowledge graphs.

#### Methods:

- `reason_over_path`: Performs reasoning over paths between two entities
- `detect_conflicts`: Detects logical conflicts in the knowledge graph
- `resolve_conflicts`: Attempts to resolve detected conflicts
- `infer_new_relationships`: Infers new relationships based on existing knowledge

### Helper Functions

The module also provides helper functions for common reasoning patterns:

- `reason_over_paths`: Wrapper for path-based reasoning
- `detect_graph_conflicts`: Wrapper for conflict detection
- `resolve_graph_conflicts`: Wrapper for conflict resolution
- `infer_new_knowledge`: Wrapper for relationship inference

## Reasoning Types

### Path-based Reasoning

The module analyzes paths between entities to derive insights and infer relationships. For example:

- If A has-skill B and B required-for C, then A qualified-for C
- If A is-a B and B is-a C, then A is-a C (transitive reasoning)

### Conflict Detection

The module can detect different types of conflicts:

- **Contradictory Relationships**: When there are conflicting relationship types between two entities (e.g., "works-for" vs. "not-affiliated-with")
- **Property Conflicts**: When entities with the same name and type have conflicting attribute values
- **Semantic Inconsistencies**: Such as circular hierarchies in transitive relationships

### Conflict Resolution

The module can automatically resolve detected conflicts:

- For contradictory relationships, it keeps the relationship with higher confidence
- For property conflicts, it merges attributes from the entity with higher confidence
- For circular hierarchies, it breaks the cycle by removing the relationship with lowest confidence

### Inference

The module can infer new relationships:

- **Transitive Relationships**: Based on transitive properties (e.g., is-a, part-of)
- **Symmetric Relationships**: Adding reverse relationships for symmetric relation types
- **Inverse Relationships**: Adding inverse relationships (e.g., if A works-for B, then B employs A)

## Usage Example

Here's a simple example of using the Graph Reasoning module:

```python
from src.graph_management.graph import KnowledgeGraph
from src.graph_management.graph_reasoning import reason_over_paths, detect_graph_conflicts, resolve_graph_conflicts, infer_new_knowledge

# Create or load a knowledge graph
graph = KnowledgeGraph(name="my_graph")
# ... add entities and relationships ...

# Perform path-based reasoning
paths_result = reason_over_paths(graph, "entity1_id", "entity2_id")

# Detect conflicts
conflicts = detect_graph_conflicts(graph)

# Resolve conflicts
resolution_result = resolve_graph_conflicts(graph)

# Infer new relationships
inferences = infer_new_knowledge(graph)
```

## Integration with Other Modules

The Graph Reasoning module integrates with:

- **Graph Management**: Uses the KnowledgeGraph class and GraphQuery for graph operations
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Complements the knowledge extraction process by inferring additional relationships
- **Theory Formation**: Provides foundation for more advanced reasoning in the Theory Formation module

## Future Enhancements

Possible future enhancements to the Graph Reasoning module:

1. Integration with LLM for more complex reasoning patterns
2. Support for probabilistic reasoning
3. Enhanced rule-based inference capabilities
4. Temporal reasoning for analyzing changes over time
5. Support for more complex reasoning patterns specific to different domains
